# 📊 Resume Data Analysis Project

## 🧩 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of a **Data Science & Data Analytics Internship Task**.  
It focuses on applying the **data science workflow** end-to-end:

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing values, duplicates, inconsistent formatting.  
   - Extract useful information from raw resume text (skills, experience, education).

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Identify top skills, education levels, and experience ranges.  
   - Visualize relationships between attributes using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

3. **Statistical Analysis**  
   - Test relationships (e.g., between education and role) using Chi-Square, t-tests, etc.

4. **Predictive Modeling** *(optional)*  
   - Build a text classification model using **TF-IDF + Logistic Regression** to classify resumes into job roles or categories.

5. **Dashboard / App (Optional Extension)**  
   - Build an interactive **Streamlit dashboard** to visualize insights and allow predictions from new resume text.
